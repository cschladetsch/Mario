Each area has it's own UI under the top-level Canvas scene object, and also it's own script to
control behavior for the level and what happens when you switch between areas.

There's an argument to be made to add these Areas directly to the corresponding Panel in the  Canvas.

Currently they are hooked up in code via naming convention, which is probably a bad choice.
