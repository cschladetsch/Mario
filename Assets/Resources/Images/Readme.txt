These are used to show goal items in the goal bar.

This may well be redundant, as we could also use values in Prefabs/IngredientInfos, but
at the time I expected the goal images may be different and/or have different behavior
than the actual items used on the conveyor belts and in the bakery area.

This may be something to remedy later if it becomes an issue.
